1. pamac install magnum-integration-git
2. pamac install imgui
3. if it hasn't been fixed yet, change ImGui::ImGui to ImGui in /usr/share/cmake/MagnumIntegration/FindMagnumIntegration.cmake so it builds
4. add /usr/include/MagnumExternal/ImGui/ to include dirs so Context.hpp includes the imgui headers that come with magnum bc the other ones don't work...

CMakeLists.txt:


find_package( MagnumIntegration REQUIRED ImGui )

include_directories( /usr/include/MagnumExternal/ImGui/ )

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} MagnumIntegration::ImGui)
